	IRC bot module - by Matt Johnson (MCMLXXIX) - 2010
	This is a sample IRC bot module to demonstrate how such modules work.
	More than one module can be loaded into the main IRC bot at a time,
	but be careful when setting your bot commands (in '<botname>_commands.js')
	if there are duplicate command names, they will be superseded in the order
	in which they are loaded (in the order they are listed in ircbot.ini).
