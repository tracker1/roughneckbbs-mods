			<response>Hello, young warrior. Beautiful FOUNTAIN, isn't it? It's my favorite place in this FOREST. I gave up my quest for glory for a simpler life, so you'll always find me here.</response>

			<response>This is one of the few truly safe places in this world. You needn't worry about doing battle here. The energy here also aids regeneration.</response>

		<trigger id="forest">
			<response>This is a great place to start out. There's plenty of forest to wander through, and plenty of creatures to hunt. And, if you find yourself injured, you can always come meditate here. You'll be like new in no time.</response>
