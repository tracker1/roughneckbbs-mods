This is an example of the Synchronet Interface File (SIF) Format:

To execute this SIF, yype ;SIF at the main prompt and enter EXAMPLE as the 
filename.

Only text between STX (Start of text / Ctrl-B) and ETX (End of text / Ctrl-C)
will be displayed to the user. After each ETX is the input mode specifier
('c'haracter or 's'tring), then an optional mode modifier ('u'ppercase,
'n'umeric, or 'f'orced captialization), then an optional 'l' for an input line
to be displayed, then an optional 'r' if the data file should contain a CRLF
after this field, then the maximum length of the string (if 's'tring mode and a
template isn't specified), then an optional . followed by the minimum length
of the string, and last an optional string in double-quotes that either
specifies what keys will be accepted ('c'haracter mode) or an input template
('s'tring mode).

Inside the text area, we should use Synchronet Ctrl-A sequences for changing
the text attributes and clearing the screen. Embeded ANSI sequences can be used
but are not suggested as they will be displayed to ALL users (ANSI or not), and
Ctrl-A sequences are filtered for non-ANSI users, and modified for Monochrome
ANSI users. See SBBS\TEXT\MENU\ATTR.ALL for more information on Ctrl-A codes.
