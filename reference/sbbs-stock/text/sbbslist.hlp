n4hc List Mode n

While in List Mode, the prompt on the last line of the terminal should display
the ncþ hList ncþn prompt, waiting for one of the following command keys:
    
    hwSngort, hwRngeverse, hwGngoTo, hwFngind, fmt:0-9, hwMngore, hwQnguit, or [View] hw?

nYou can move through list of BBS entries using the naviagation keys: up, down,
home, end, page-up, and page-down.

n4hc List Format n

While listing the BBSes, the entries are listed, one row per BBS. However,
not all of the BBS's details can be displayed on a 80-column (typical)
terminal.

The visible columns of detail (the "format") can be scrolled left and right by
using the left and right arrow keys or by pressing a number key, 0 through 9 to
go directly to a specific list format:

  h0n: Sysops, Location
  h1n: Phone Number, Service Address
  h2n: Since, Software, Web Site
  h3n: Description
  h4n: Networks
  h5n: Nodes, Users, Subs, Dirs, Doors, Msgs, Files, Storage
  h6n: Protocols
  h7n: Created By, Created On
  h8n: Updated By, Updated On
  h9n: Verified By, Verified On

n4hc List Sorting n

The list may be sorted by any visible column. Use the 's' key to cycle through
sorting of each column (capital 'S' to cycle backwards). Columns containing
text are sorted alphabetically (e.g. A-Z) while most numeric columns are sorted
largest to smallest value. The current list order may be reversed using the
hRngeversen command. The sort-field column is highlighted by inverse colors and an
ALL CAPS heading.

n4hc Go to a BBS Entry n

The 'G' key may be used to select a specific BBS entry by typing it's name or
one of it's service addresses (e.g. "vertrauen" or "vert.synchro.net").

n4hc Find BBS Entries n

The 'F' key may be used to find text in the BBS list and filter (only display)
those entires which contain the typed text (case insensitive).

n4hc More Options n

The 'M' key may be used to display the ncþ hMore ncþn prompt which contains the
additional commands: hwAngdd, hwEngdit, hwRngemove, hwDngownload, hwSngort, hwFngormatn

The hwAngddn command is used to add a new BBS entry to the list.

The hwSngortn and hwFngormatn commands behave much like they do on the ncþ hList ncþn prompt,
except a menu of available sort fields and formats is displayed instead of
instantly switching/cycling through them.

The hwEngditn and hwRngemoven commands are used to modify (or remove) an existing BBS
entry in the list. You must be the author of the selected BBS entry (or a
sysop) to have these commands available to you.

The hwDngownloadn command may be used to download the BBS list in either SyncTERM
list format (syncterm.lst) or JSON (sbbslist.json).

n4hc Detail Mode n

The Enter key is used to display the details of the selected BBS entry. While
in Detail Mode, the ncþ hDetail ncþ nprompt may contain the commands:

     gpreview:hwLngive/hwCngap, hwEngdit, hwRngemove, hwJngSON, hwVngerify or hwQnguit:n

The hwLngiven or hwCngapn command, when available, may be used to view a preview of the
selected BBS's answer/login screen. A "live" preview will initiate an outbound
Telnet connection to the BBS while a "capture" preview will display the stored
preview (if a preview has been previusly captured).

The hwVngerifyn command may be used to verify (vouch for) the accuracy of the
selected BBS entry (e.g. it's still "up" and answering "calls"), thus
preventing or delaying auto-deletion of the entry.

The hwEngditn and hwRngemoven commands behave the same as the do at the ncþ hMore ncþn prompt
while the hwJngSONn command is for hand-editing the JSON-representation of the BBS
entry (use with caution).

nYou can move through list of BBS entries using the naviagation keys: up, down,
home, end, page-up, and page-down (while in Detail and Preview modes).

n4hc Alternative Navigation Keys n

If some of the navigation keys (e.g. arrow keys, home, end) do not work for
your terminal, you can try using these alternatives:
  ù Up Arrow: Ctrl-^
  ù Down Arrow: Ctrl-J
  ù Left Arrow: Ctrl-]
  ù Right Arrow: Ctrl-F
  ù Home: Ctrl-B
  ù End: Ctrl-E
